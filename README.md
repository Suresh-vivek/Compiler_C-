# Creating compiler in C++

## Introduction

This is a simple compiler that I have created in C++. It is a simple compiler that can compile a simple language that I have created. The language is a simple language that can do simple arithmetic operations. The compiler can compile the code and generate the assembly code for the code. The assembly code can be run on a x86-64 machine. The compiler is written in C++ and uses the flex and bison libraries for the lexer and parser.
